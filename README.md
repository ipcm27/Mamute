    <h1>Introduction to JDBC, JPA, and Spring JDBC</h1>
    
    <h2>JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)</h2>
    <p>JDBC is a Java API that allows Java applications to connect to a relational database and perform operations such as queries, inserts, and updates. It provides an interface for interacting with different types of databases using JDBC drivers specific to each database.</p>

    <h2>JPA (Java Persistence API)</h2>
    <p>JPA is a Java API that simplifies the development of Java applications that need to persist data in a relational database. It provides a set of interfaces and annotations for mapping Java objects to database tables and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.</p>

    <h2>Spring JDBC</h2>
    <p>Spring JDBC is an extension of the Spring framework that simplifies the use of JDBC in Java applications. It provides utility classes and templates that help reduce the amount of boilerplate code required to interact with the database using JDBC. Spring JDBC also offers support for transaction management, named queries, and result mapping.</p>

    <h2>Why is it better to use these technologies?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Database Abstraction:</strong> JDBC, JPA, and Spring JDBC provide abstractions that make interacting with the database easier, reducing the complexity and coupling of code to a specific database.</li>
        <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> These technologies allow developers to build robust applications more quickly and efficiently, providing simple APIs and powerful tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> With features such as transaction control and connection management, JDBC, JPA, and Spring JDBC help ensure data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Using these technologies can facilitate code maintenance, making it more readable, organized, and easy to understand.</li>
    </ul>
